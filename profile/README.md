# Garden Grow
Garden Grow is a website designed to help gardeners determine their USDA hardiness zone and obtain detailed information about vegetables that are suitable for their zone. By entering their zipcode, users can discover their zone and learn when to plant, care for, and harvest various vegetables that are adapted to their specific climate.

## Getting Started
To get started with Garden Grow, simply navigate to the website and enter your zipcode. You'll be able to view information about the vegetables that are best suited to your area and learn how to grow them successfully.
